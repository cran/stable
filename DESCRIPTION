Description: Density, distribution, quantile and hazard functions of a
    stable variate; generalized regression models for the parameters
    of a stable distribution. See the README for how to make equivalent calls
    to those of 'stabledist' (i.e., Nolan's 0-parameterization and 
    1-parameterization as detailed in Nolan (2020)). 
    See github for Lambert and Lindsey 1999 JRSS-C journal article, 
    which details the parameterization of the Buck (1995) stable.   
    See the Details section of the `?dstable` help file for context and 
    references.
